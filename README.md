# bonn-lecture-notes

These are my personal notes for the courses:

Advanced Topics in Topology - __Koszul Duality__ at the University of Bonn in the winter semester 2024/25 taught by [Dr.Yuqing Shi](https://yuqingshi.bitbucket.io/teaching/kd.html).

There are still *some* missing proofs as well as some structure and formatting issues, which I shall resolve to fix in the short term.


I claim no responsibility to any incorrect, hazy or misleading information contained in these notes - they are to be read at one's own risk.
That being said, if you do find typos, inconsistencies or incorrect information: feel free to send me an email at wydra@uni-bonn.de.
