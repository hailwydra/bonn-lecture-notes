These are my personal notes for the courses:

Advanced Topics in Topology - __Koszul Duality__ at the University of Bonn in the winter semester 2024/25 taught by (Dr.Yuqing Shi)[https://yuqingshi.bitbucket.io/teaching/kd.html].

As of 28/01/2025 these are missing lectures
* 12/12

as well as some structure and formatting issues, which I shall resolve to fix in the short term.
